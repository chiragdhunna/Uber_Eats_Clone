# Uber_Eats_Clone

Hey there! Welcome to my Uber Eats Clone repository!
🚀 I'm thrilled to share with you my very first mobile application, created from scratch using React Native, Firebase, Yelp API, Places API, Redux, and Google Autocomplete.
This project aims to bring the convenience of ordering food right to your fingertips, just like the popular Uber Eats app.

Features:
🍔 Easy Ordering Experience: I've worked hard to make the app super user-friendly. You can now browse through a bunch of amazing restaurants, check out their menus, and effortlessly place your orders with a few taps.

🚚 Real-time Tracking: I've added a cool feature that lets you keep an eye on your order's progress in real time. You'll know exactly when to expect that delicious food at your doorstep!

🔍 Customizable Filters: Thanks to the awesome Yelp API, you can now find restaurants based on your location, favorite cuisines, ratings, and more. It's like having your own personal food guide!

🔒 Secure Authentication: I've integrated Firebase Authentication to ensure that your registration, login, and profile details are all kept safe and secure.

💳 Smooth Payment Process: With the help of popular payment gateways, you can complete your transactions within the app, making the whole experience seamless and hassle-free.

📚 Order History and Ratings: I know how important it is to keep track of your past orders and share your feedback. You can now access your order history, rate restaurants, and make informed choices for future orders.

📱 Responsive Design: I've designed the app to work flawlessly on both iOS and Android devices. You can enjoy a consistent experience no matter which platform you're on!

Tech Stack:
✨ React Native: I used this amazing JavaScript framework to build the app from scratch. It allowed me to create a fully functional mobile application for both iOS and Android.

🔥 Firebase: With Firebase, I was able to handle all the backend aspects of the app, including user authentication, real-time database updates, and cloud functions. It made my life so much easier!

🌟 Yelp API: Thanks to the Yelp API, I was able to integrate a massive database of restaurants, menus, and ratings into my app. Now you have access to a wide variety of dining options!

📍 Places API: The Places API from Google helped me implement an autocomplete feature for location search. It suggests addresses, making it super convenient for you to enter your delivery address.

🔄 Redux: To manage the app's state in a predictable manner, I used Redux. It allowed me to easily keep track of important data throughout the app.

If you're a beginner like me, or simply interested in creating your own food delivery app, this Uber Eats Clone is a great starting point. Feel free to explore the code, experiment with the features, and make it your own!

Let's embark on this exciting journey together and build our own food delivery app revolution! If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding! 😄
